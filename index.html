                    Ryomen Sukuna is the main antagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga series created by Gege Akutami. He is a Cursed Spirit born out of the negative emotions flowing from humans, and was once known as the King of Curses over a thousand years ago, the undisputed most powerful Cursed Spirit of all time.
                    Sukuna was a powerful sorcerer in his human life, and after his death, his body was divided into 20 fingers that were sealed away. Over the centuries, the fingers have been scattered and lost, until they were eventually rediscovered by Yuji Itadori. Yuji ingested one of Sukuna's fingers in an attempt to save his friend, and as a result, Sukuna was able to partially possess Yuji's body.
                    Sukuna is a cruel and sadistic being who enjoys causing pain and suffering. He is also incredibly powerful, with a mastery of cursed energy that is unmatched by any other Cursed Spirit. Sukuna's strength is such that even Satoru Gojo, the strongest jujutsu sorcerer in the world, has acknowledged that he would be a difficult opponent.
                    Sukuna's goal is to regain control of his full body and become the King of Curses once again. He believes that he is the rightful ruler of the world, and that humans are nothing but maggots that deserve to be crushed under his heel. Sukuna is a major threat to the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, and it is up to Yuji and his friends to stop him before it's too late.
                    Sukuna is a formidable opponent, and he is one of the most dangerous Cursed Spirits in the world. He is a threat to both humans and jujutsu sorcerers alike, and it is up to Yuji and his friends to stop him before it's too late.
